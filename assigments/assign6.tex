\begin{question}
Consider the following  recursively defined set of numbers:\\
 \\
Base Case: $2 \in H$\\
Constructor Case: if $h \in H$, then $2+\sqrt{h}  \in H$ and $2-\sqrt{h} \in H$.\\
 \\
Prove, using a well ordering proof, that this definition is unambiguous,\\
i.e.~every number in $H$ can be obtained from the rules in only one way.\\
 \\
You may find it helpful to first prove upper and lower bounds on the numbers in $H$.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
{\bf Solution:}\\
{\bf Lemma \#1:} Show $2$ is the only rational number in $H$ - Proof by structural induction:\\
{\bf Definitions}:\\
$F(h): H \rightarrow \{T,F\} = h\ne 2\Implies I(h)$\\
$I(x): \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \{T,F\} = x$ is a irrational number\\\\
{\bf Base Cases: }\\
\null\quad Assume $h=2$\\
\null\quad $Q(2)$\\
\null\quad Since $2\ne2$ is false, $2\ne 2\Implies I(2)$ is vaccuously true.\\
$F(2)$\\\\
{\bf Constructor Cases: }\\
\null\quad Let $h\in H$ be arbitrary:\\
\null\qquad Assume $F(h)$ (I.H.)\\
\null\qquad Case 1: $h = 2$\\
\null\qquad By the I.H. $h\ne 2\Implies I(h)$\\
\null\qquad Since $h=2$, $\Not I(h)$.\\
\null\qquad $I(\sqrt 2)$: Axiom \\
\null\qquad Addition/subtraction of a rational and irrational number is always irrational: Axiom\\
\null\qquad Therefore $I(2\pm\sqrt2)$\\
\null\qquad Case 2: $h\ne2$\\
\null\qquad By the I.H. $h\ne 2\Implies I(h)$\\
\null\qquad Since $h\ne2$, $I(h)$\\
\null\qquad The square root of an irrational number is also irrational: Axiom\\
\null\qquad Therefore $I(\sqrt h)$\\
\null\qquad $\Not I(2)$: Axiom\\
\null\qquad Addition/subtraction of a rational and irrational number is always irrational: Axiom:\\
\null\qquad $I(2\pm\sqrt h)$\\
\null\quad Therefore $F(h)\Implies F(2\pm\sqrt h)$\\
Since $h$ is arbitrary, by structural induction $\forall h\in H.F(h)$\\
Since every either constructor gives an irrational number no matter the input, there is only one way to obtain $2$. (The base case)\\\\
{\bf Lemma \#2:} - Proving that $\forall h\in H.(h\le 4)$\\
Assume on the contrary that $4\in H$.\\
Since $4>2$, $\exists x\in H.(2+\sqrt x = 4)$\\
$2+\sqrt x = 4$  $\sqrt x = 2$  $x = 4$\\
Therefore the only way to create $4$ with the constructors is with itself.\\
This is a contradiction therefore it is not possible to create the value $4$ and every value must be less than $4$\\
{\bf Lemma \#3:} - Proving that $\forall h\in H.(h\ge 0)$\\
To get a value less than $2$, the $2-\sqrt h$ constructor must be used. As shown in Lemma \#2, every value in $h$ is less than $4$. Therefore every value in $H$ must be greater than $2-\sqrt 4 = 0$.\\\\
{\bf Definitions:}\\
$P(x): H\rightarrow \{T,F\} = $ The element $x$ can only be obtained from the rules in one way\\
$x\preccurlyeq y: H\times H \rightarrow \{T,F\} =$ The number of times that a constructor was applied to make $x$ is less or equal to the amount for $y$ \\
{\bf Proof:}\\
Let $C =\{h\in H|\Not [P(h)]\}$\\
$\preccurlyeq$ is a well ordering for $H$ with $2$ as the smallest element. Since $C\subseteq H$ $C$ is well ordered.\\
\null\quad Assume on the contrary $C\ne\emptyset$ \\
\null\quad Let $x$ be the smallest element in $C$ by $\preccurlyeq$\\
\null\quad\quad Let $a\in H$ be arbitrary\\
\null\qquad\quad Assume $a\preccurlyeq x$\\
\null\qquad\quad As shown in the lemma \#1, the base case 2 can only be made in one way. The base \\
\null\qquad\quad case is by definition less than $x$ with the well ordering $\preccurlyeq$. \\
\null\qquad\quad Therefore there always exists a value $a\preccurlyeq x$ st $P(a)$\\
\null\quad\quad $a\preccurlyeq x\Implies P(a)$\\
\null\quad $\forall a\in H.(a\preccurlyeq x\Implies P(a))$\\
\null\quad Since $x\in C$, it must be able to be made in two ways. There are three possibilities:  \\
\null\qquad Case 1: $\exists a,b\in H.(2+\sqrt a = 2+\sqrt b = x)$\\
\null\qquad $2+\sqrt a = 2+\sqrt b$\\
\null\qquad $\sqrt a = \sqrt b$\\
\null\qquad Since all values in $H$ are greater than $0$ as shown in lemma \#3:\\
\null\qquad $a = b$\\
\null\qquad $a\preccurlyeq x$ and $b\preccurlyeq x$ by the definition of $\preccurlyeq$, therefore $P(a)$ and $P(b)$\\
\null\qquad $a$ and $b$ are the same element obtained in the same way.\\
\null\qquad $ 2+\sqrt a$ and $2+\sqrt b$ are the same constructor\\
\null\qquad Case 2: $\exists a,b\in H.(2-\sqrt a = 2-\sqrt b = x)$ $a$ and $b$ obtained from the rules differently\\
\null\qquad $-\sqrt a = -\sqrt b$\\
\null\qquad Since all values in $H$ are greater than $0$ as shown in lemma \#2:\\
\null\qquad $a = b$\\
\null\qquad $a\preccurlyeq x$ and $b\preccurlyeq x$ by the definition of $\preccurlyeq$, therefore $P(a)$ and $P(b)$\\
\null\qquad This is a contradiction since $a$ and $b$ must be obtained differently\\
\null\qquad Case 3: $\exists a,b\in H.(2+\sqrt a = 2-\sqrt b = x)$\\
\null\qquad $2+\sqrt a = 2-\sqrt b$ \\
\null\qquad $\sqrt a = -\sqrt b$\\
\null\qquad This is a contradiction since the output of a square root is always positive: Axiom\\
\null\quad Therefore there is no way to create the smallest element in $C$\\
By the well ordering principle: $C=\emptyset$\\
$\forall h\in H.P(h)$

\begin{question}
The set $S$ of strict binary trees can be defined inductively as follows:\\
Base case: $\bullet$ is a strict binary tree, with $\bullet$ as its root\\
Constructor case: If $t_1$ and $t_2$ are strict binary trees, then\\
$\bullet$ is the root of the strict binary tree in which $\bullet$ is connected via edges to the roots of $t_1$ and $t_2$.\\

Prove that the set of all strict binary trees is countable.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
{\bf Solution:}\\
{\bf Definitions:}\\
Define a coordinate system $(x,y): \nats\times\nats$ such that $(0,0)$ is the root of the tree.\\
Each level of the tree can possibly have $2^y$ $\bullet$ and will have $2^y$ corresponding $x$ coordinates (starting at 0). Each $x$ coordinate represents a possible place for a $\bullet$ from left to right.\\
The row below the root will have a $y$ coordinate of $1$ and this pattern will continue throughout the depth of the tree.\\\\
$h(a): S\rightarrow \nats$= The height of the binary tree $a$ \\
$b(a, (x, y)): S\times (\nats\times\nats)\rightarrow \{0,1\} =$ If there is a $\bullet$ at the position $(x,y)$ in the tree $a$ function returns $1$ and returns $0$ if not \\
$P_i: \nats\rightarrow\nats = $ The $(i-1)$th prime number (ie $P(0) = 2, P(1) = 3$ ...)\\
The function $F(a)$ is a surjective function from $S\rightarrow \nats$\\
$$F(a): S\rightarrow \nats= \sum_{i=0}^{h(a)}\left[P_i\sum_{j=0}^{2^i}\left[2^j\cdot b(a,(j,i))\right]\right]$$\\
Using the function $b$ defined above, the inner sum will result in a natural number that when converted to base 2 will have a length of $2^i$ (the max possible width at that $y$ coordinate). Each digit in this binary string represents a possible location for a $\bullet$ (1 if there is one there and 0 if there isn't). Since each place in the binary string has a unique value, there will be a unique corresponding natural number for every possible row with that width.  \\\\
For every row in the binary tree, the unique numerical value of that row is multiplied by a unique prime number then added to all other rows in the outer sum. By the Fundamental theorem of arithmatic, a unique product of primes will result in a unique number. Each binary tree input will output a unique natural number. \\\\
Given an arbitrary natural number in the format described above, finding the number of occurances of each factor and converting them into binary will give the positions of all $\bullet$s in each row. This information can be used to construct the binary tree.
Therefore there is a surjective function from $\nats \rightarrow S$ and by extension $S$ is countable.
