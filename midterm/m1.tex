\begin{question}
(15 marks)
Recall that $\mathscr{P}(\ints)$ denotes all sets of integers.\\
Let $\mathscr{F} = \{ {\cal F} \subseteq \mathscr{P}(\ints)\ |\ {\cal F}$ is finite\} denote all finite families of sets of integers.\\
Note that, for some ${\cal F} \in \mathscr{F}$, some of the sets in ${\cal F}$ may be infinite.

Recall that ${\cal F}$ is a  {\em cover} of $S \in \mathscr{P}(\ints)$
if  each element of $S$ belongs to at least one set in ${\cal F}$.\\
${\cal F}$ is a {\em minimal cover} of $S$ if
${\cal F}$ is a cover of $S$,
but  no proper subset of ${\cal F}$ is a cover of  $S$.

${\cal F}$ is a {\em minimum cover} of $S$ from ${\cal G} \in \mathscr{F}$
if ${\cal F} \subseteq {\cal G}$, ${\cal F}$ is a cover of $S$,  and no family of  sets ${\cal F'} \subseteq {\cal G}$
that contains fewer sets than ${\cal F}$ is a cover of $S$.
\end{question}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
\begin{question}
Give a  finite family of sets ${\cal G}  \in \mathscr{F}$, a family of sets ${\cal F} \subseteq {\cal G}$, and a set $S \in \mathscr{P}(\ints)$ such that ${\cal F}$ is a {\em minimal cover} of $S$ but
${\cal F}$ is not a {\em minimum cover} of $S$ from ${\cal G}$. \\
Briefly justify your answer.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
Let $S = \{1,2,3\}$\\
Let ${\cal G} =  \{\{1\},\{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}\}$\\
Let ${\cal F} = \{\{1\}, \{2,3\}\}$\\\\
In this senario, ${\cal F}$ is a minimal cover for the set $S$ as no proper subset of ${\cal F}$ is a cover for $S$. (The only proper subsets are $\{\{1\}\}$ and $\{\{2,3\}\}$)\\\\
${\cal F}$ is not a minimum set however since there exists a subset of ${\cal G}$ (namely $\{\{1,2,3\}\}$) that is a cover for $S$ and since ${\cal F}$ contains $2$ elements and $\{\{1,2,3\}\}$ contains $1$ \\
\end{solution}

\item
\begin{question}
Express ``${\cal F}$ is a {\em minimal cover} of $S$'' as a predicate using only quantifiers, logical connectives,
and the predicates $=$, Contains, and Cover,
where, for any set $S \in \mathscr{P}(\ints)$ and any finite family of sets of integers ${\cal F} \in \mathscr{F}$,\\
${\rm Contains}({\cal F},S $) = ``${\cal F}$ contains $S$'' and\\
${\rm Cover}({\cal F},S $) = ``${\cal F}$ is a cover for $S$''.\\
Briefly justify your answer.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
$${\rm MinimalCover}({\cal F},S): \mathscr{F}\times \mathscr{P}(\ints)\rightarrow \{T,F\} ={\rm Cover}({\cal F},S) \And $$
$$[\forall{\cal F'}\in\mathscr{F}. \left(\forall  A\in {\cal F'}.{\rm Contains}({\cal F}, A) \And \Not({\cal F'} = {\cal F})\right)$$
$$\Implies \Not({\rm Cover}({\cal F'}, S) ]$$\\
There are $2$ conditions that must be satisfied for ${\cal F}$ to be a minimal cover of $S$ represented on both sides of the main conjunction:\\
1. ${\cal F}$ must be a cover of $S$. This is the left side of the main conjunction ${\rm Cover}({\cal F}, S)$. \\
2. Every proper subset (${\cal F'}$) of ${\cal F}$ ${\cal F'}$ is not a cover (the right side.)The hypothesis of the implication checks if ${\cal F'}\in \mathscr{F}$ is a proper subset of ${\cal F}$. If it is then it must not be a cover of $S$. If it isn't then the statement is vaccuously true.\\\\
\end{solution}

\item
\begin{question}
Express ``${\cal F}$ is a {\em minimum cover} of $S$ from ${\cal G}$'' as a predicate using
only quantifiers, logical connectives, and the predicates $=$, Contains, and Cover.\\
You may also use the set
${\cal R}^{\cal D}$
of all functions from ${\cal D}$ to ${\cal R}$,
where ${\cal D}, {\cal R} \in \mathscr{F}$ are finite families of sets of integers.\\
Briefly justify your answer.
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
$${\rm MinimumCover}({\cal F}, S, {\cal G})=$$
$$ \forall A\in{\cal F}.{\rm Contains}({\cal G}, A)\And {\rm Cover}({\cal F}, S) \And $$
$$[\forall{\cal F'}\in\mathscr{F}. (\forall B\in {\cal F'}.{\rm Contains}({\cal G}, B)\And |{\cal F'}| < |{\cal F}|) \Implies \Not {\rm Cover}({\cal F'}, S)]$$\\
The first condition $\forall A\in{\cal F}.{\rm Contains}({\cal G}, A)$ checks if ${\cal F}$ is a subset of ${\cal G}$.\\
The second condition ${\rm Cover}({\cal F}, S)$ ensures that ${\cal F}$ is a cover for $S$.\\
The third condition checks if any ${\cal F'}\subseteq {\cal G}$ with less elements than ${\cal F}$ is a cover for $S$
